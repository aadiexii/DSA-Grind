# 🚀 Coding Journey

## 📅 Start Date
**1st August 2025**

## 📖 About
A personal journey of consistent development and growth.  

- 👨‍💻 Building and coding every day  
- 🔄 Pushing code to GitHub regularly  
- 📊 Tracking progress over months to reflect the hard work  

## 🎯 My Goals
- Solve **2+ LeetCode problems daily** (including the POTD)  
- Solve **1 Codeforces problem daily** from the CP31 sheet  
- Never miss any **Codeforces contests**  
- On contest days → only solve **POTD + contest problems + upsolving**

🔥 Consistency is the key. Let’s build something great!
